👋 Hi, I'm Michael Weiner.

You have found the public repository for my personal website that can be found at [https://michaelweiner.org](https://michaelweiner.org).

## Tools Used to Build the Site

This site is built using:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com)
- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

## Development

To run the site locally:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

This will generate git metadata and start the Jekyll server with live reload.

Go to http://localhost:4000 to view the site.

## Content Structure

The site uses a flexible content section system configured in `_config.yml`. By default, content is organized under "Guides" but this can be renamed by updating the `content_section` settings. See [docs/RENAMING_CONTENT_SECTION.md](docs/RENAMING_CONTENT_SECTION.md) for details on customizing the content section name.

## Credits

This site's Jekyll theme, HTML structure, and CSS styling are based on the [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org) website. The original design and code were created by the talented team at [37signals](https://37signals.com)/Basecamp and can be found at [github.com/basecamp/kamal-site](https://github.com/basecamp/kamal-site).

While I've adapted and modified the code for my personal use (removing Kamal-specific content, changing fonts, updating navigation, etc.), the core design, layout system, and much of the CSS remain from their excellent work.

## Questions

Please email me with any comments or concerns. Have a great day!
